# wraith_module_comosum

A Wraith communications module based on the Yggdrasil p2p network.

### What's with the name?

*Chlorophytum comosum* is otherwise known as the spider plant - a name I thought fitting for software which combines Yggdrasil (a mythological plant), with Wraith (a creepy software that crawls around finding bugs).
